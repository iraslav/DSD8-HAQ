// register_file.v -- 8 x 8 registers, two read ports, one write port
// Owner: member B -- this is YOUR module; you are individually examined
// on it at the oral defence.
// Spec: Section 5.6. Port list is FROZEN.
//
// What is required (R14):
//   - all eight registers clear to 0x00 on reset
//   - reads are combinational
//   - a write and a read of the same register on the same cycle return
//     the OLD value on the read ports; the new value is visible from
//     the next cycle onward (do not add write-through forwarding you
//     were not asked for -- it will not match the reference)
//
// Verified by tb/tb_register_file.v.
